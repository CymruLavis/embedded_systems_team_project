Note to developers: after connecting this repo to your local machine any additional 
class files that need to be used in execution need to be added to the CMakeLists.txt file. That is done by adding 
src/<filename>.cpp to the add_exacutable chain

to run the program make sure you are in the build directory then run the following

>> make
>> ./cocktail_machine

make is the command that will compile the project with our cmake architecture
./cocktail_machine executes/runs the project
